# Solo Retreat Planner

A single-user, offline-first Android application for planning and executing solo meditation retreats. Built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, Hilt, and WorkManager.

## Architecture Overview

The app follows a clean MVVM + Repository architecture with three distinct phases:

- **Preparation** — Create retreat plan, build schedule, download talks, complete checklist
- **Retreat** — Guided daily practice with timer, precept tracking, meal logging
- **Integration** — Journal entries and retreat summary with export

- YouTube talks are explicitly excluded per architecture requirements — UI shows appropriate messaging.
